# Simple vehicle plate recognition

This simple vehicle (Chinese vehicles only) plate recognition was used for the purpose of teaching in Digital Image Processing Course. I was the Teaching Assistant of this course and I had prepared MATLAB and python version code and they are mostly same. The only difference lay on how to distinguish the extracted characters in the plate. MATLAB version code was with the help of svm classifier while python with Convolutional Neural Network. The trained model files folder was named `train_data`. Since this project was three years ago, some of the project structure might in mess so you need to roughly glance over the project code. Don't worry however, there is no a big problem in this project. Feel free to contact me and raise issues if there is any problem.
